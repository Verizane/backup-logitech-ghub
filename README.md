# backup-logitech-ghub
This is a copy of Ginden's ghub backup script, thankfully it is still working.

One addition I had to do to improve though:

I have read on reddit, that the local AND the roaming folder were necessary to backup, so I added it and also I prefer the ghub-backup folder inside my documents folder so I did that too.
